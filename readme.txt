== Frequently Asked Questions ==

For advanced analytics and revenue recovery solutions install: [Admiral Adblock Analytics](https://wordpress.org/plugins/admiral-adblock-suite/)

= How does this plugin treat visitors with JavaScript disabled? =
At this time, this plugin does not treat disabled JavaScript as an adblocker.
If the visitor has JavaScript disabled, the plugin displays the content used
for normal visitors with no adblockers.

= Does this plugin prevent visitors with an adblocker from visiting my site or in any other way obscure the content? =
It was not designed to do so, but it is possible to replicate that behavior in an indirect way.
This plugin's purpose is to simply places alternative content in the space the ad would have displayed.

= Why doesn't this plugin detect the _______________ adblocker? =
Not all adblockers operate the same way.  This plugin was tested with the most common adblockers, but it is possible one was missed.  If you find an adblocker this plugin doesn’t detect, visit the Report a Problem tab in the plugin's dashboard
for information on testing and reporting undetected adblockers.

= Can this plugin integrate with other ad management plugins? =
This plugin recognizes shortcodes from other sources.  Some ad management plugins use
shortcodes to output their ads.  You can use the shortcode generated by other plugins inside *Ad Block Detector*, allowing you to display ads from ad management plugins while harnessing the power of adblock detection.
